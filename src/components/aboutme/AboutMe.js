            and I am a web developer who specializes in front end development. My main
            tools are Javascript, CSS and React.  I am currently working as a React apprentice for Bitwise Industries under Alpha Works in 
            Fresno California. I am passionate about all things technology but especially love programming. In my free time
            you can find me spending time outdoors with my family and sometimes watching the occasional 80's horror movie.
