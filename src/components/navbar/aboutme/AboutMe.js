            My name is Mike Villa. I am a web developer who specializes in front end development. My main
            tools are Javascript, CSS and React.  I am currently working as an React apprentice at Alpha Works in 
            Fresno California. If I'm not tucked away on the computer writing code or watching videos about programming,
            I'm probably spending time outside with my family. I also enjoy watching a good movie. 
            Feel free to contact me or check out my github using the links below.
